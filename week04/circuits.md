### Circuits

#### Multi LED Circuit

Control multiple LEDs with Python by making a few connections. Check out the code for this circuit on the [GPIO Control](python-gpio.md) page.

To understand why resistors are needed in this circuit, and why the 220 ohm resistor was chosen, take a look at this excellent [Sparkfun explainer](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/electricity-basics).
