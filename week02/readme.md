### Installing Sublime and Working with Python Online

You may want to download [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) to more easily edit Python code on your Mac/Windows machines.

You can also use an [online Python interpreter](https://repl.it/languages/python3) rather than running code directly on your own systems.
