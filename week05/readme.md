### Inclusive Transit Stop Design and Research Sprint

In trios, let's do some informed design work based on our readings, which have focused on how impaired people might more healthfully and equitabily engage transit infrastructure.

Please skim through this example of a design guideline document: the [Toolkit for the Assessment of Bus Stop Accessibility and Safety](https://www.nadtc.org/wp-content/uploads/NADTC-Toolkit-for-the-Assessment-of-Bus-Stop-Accessibility.pdf) and, if its level of detail is distracting, its [summary in the Metro Journal of Transit & Motorcoach Business](https://www.metro-magazine.com/accessibility/article/721873/step-by-step-designing-and-building-accessible-bus-stops). Collect your thoughts on its presentation, scope, considerations, and recommendations. Afterwards...

1. As a duo/trio, determine a set of *inclusive design principles for transit stop design* based on all of your readings and insights up till now. In particular, each group has a target audience spectrum as defined below. Reseach your audience, perhaps [construct a reductive audience spectrum if it's helpful]](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/kill-your-personas-1c332d4908cc), and write a set of 5-10 design guidelines that could constrain and guide future **transit stop design**.

	- Team A: Individuals with *visual processing impairments*
	- Team B: Individuals with *lower body mobility impairments* that use walking aids but not a wheelchair
	- Team C: Individuals with *auditory processing impairments*
	- Team D: Individuals with *social anxiety disorders* 
	- Team E: Individuals with *total body fine mobility impariment*
	- Team F: Individuals with *small stature* or *dwarfism*
	- Team G: Individuals with *upper body mobility impairments* such as Parkinsons Disease
	- Team H: Individuals with *lower body mobility impairments* that use a wheelchair
	- Team I: Individuals with *speech, reading, and language processing impairments* 

2. Visit at least three bus stops, and at least two train stations, in-person. Document the physical infrastructure and design artefacts, and markup the images with relevant measurements, callouts, and observed phenomena warranting design intervention.

3. Make a set of at least 5, but no more than 10, recommendations to improve the stations that we could pass by transit policymakers.

4. Compile all of the above into a PDF for sharing next week.
