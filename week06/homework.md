### Homework for October 1

##### Readings (1 hour)

A few readings from my very long bookmark folder on how an emphasis on user-centrism and modernist/minimalist/inevitablist impulses have led designers astray with respect to accessibility.

- [The Bauhaus isn't Our House](https://www.goines.net/Writing/bauhaus_isn%27t_our_house.html). 
- [Modernism is the Worst Thing](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-modernism-is-the-worst-thing-that-ever-happened-to-architecture-2013-7). 
- [UCD Practices Hindered an Ecologically-Sustainable Future](https://medium.com/@eilishmcvey/a-critique-of-user-centered-design-have-ucd-practices-hindered-an-ecologically-sustainable-future-da0c2b1c2ef8)
- [A Critique of the Modulor](https://failedarchitecture.com/human-all-too-human-a-critique-on-the-modulor/)
- [Cooper Hewitt's *Beautiful Users Exhibit*](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/51669015/) exhibitition, which strove to introduce a new definition of user-centrism and followed it up with 
- [Cooper Hewitt's *Access+Accessibility*](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2017/11/27/cooper-hewitt-presents-accessability-featuring-more-than-70-inclusive-designs/). 
- [HBR *Design Thinking is Fundamentally Conservative and Preserves the Status Quo*](https://hbr.org/2018/09/design-thinking-is-fundamentally-conservative-and-preserves-the-status-quo) 

Most of these are essays grounded in architectural theory, and may be using familiar language in unfamiliar ways. Record some questions, and as always, bring in your opinion and thoughts to class!

- Graham Pullin's [*Design Meets Disabilty*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lRB-g2c6-mOYRbo-Usb9As9pjDypJPDH), PDF Pages 13-45, Book Pages 1-65 (it's not so bad, lots of pictures!) 

This text is located in a very similar POV as *Mismatch* but with a very different focus and example set. We will compare and contrast it with *Mismatch* next week.

##### Find Some APIs! (1 hour)

Do some research -- are there any APIs out there that we should be implementing? From the city or state? Private organizations? This is an ongoing exercise, with no explicit deliverable. Hopefully, though,

##### Coding 

Take a look at this week's code for how to [produce a plot in Python](python-plotting.md). Run the code, go through it line by line, note any questions, and manipulate it...

	- Create a list of 3-5 bus routes near your home
	- Query the CTA Bus API for all of the stops for those routes
	- Draw a stroked circle for all the bus stops, with a specific color for each route
	- Draw a circle to show the current position of all the buses currently running the route
