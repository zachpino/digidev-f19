### Homework for November 5

##### Coding (2 hours)

Connect your Raspberry Pi LED strip to one of the several APIs we have discussed in class so far (census, bus tracker, train tracker, divvy status, something else?). Create a *dynamic visualization* using your LED strip that physicalizes some data from the selected API(s). 

For example, could the LED strip represent a series of stops on certain bus or train stops near your home, with color used to communicated the nearness of the approaching vehicle?  The overall logic is up to you -- but try to make it useful and legible.

##### Readings (1 hour)

Review from last week...

- Bess Williamson's recent [*Accessible America*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lRB-g2c6-mOYRbo-Usb9As9pjDypJPDH), PDF Pages 145-179.

This chapter narrates the increasing importance of *Universal Design* as a movement in the contemporary design world, and the many antecedents that led up to it. Williamson is trying to link together, with this chapter, the two contrary threads of designing for inclusion and accesibility that we have identified together — and I'm hopeful that some new ideas and compromises might emerge from this short chapter - especially its last few pages. 

And add...

##### Soldering Practice (2 hours)

- Make some jewelry and fashion to practice soldering! Take some wires and create some bracelets and anklets, necklaces, braided wire art, pins, garment add-ons, anything you like. Bonus points if you solder in some batteries and LEDs (don't forget resistors)!
