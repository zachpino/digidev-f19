##### Did you upgrade to Catalina?

This causes incompatiblity with Anaconda! Follow [these steps](https://www.anaconda.com/how-to-restore-anaconda-after-macos-catalina-update/) to repair the issues.

If you have a `~/opt/anaconda3/` folder, you might need to do `sudo mv ~/opt/anaconda3 ~/` **before** the linked steps above.

##### Finalizing Work

Please complete the following steps for consideration for grading by **5pm on Tuesday, December 10**


1. Make a folder in our [shared Google Drive `Final Work` folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-_xr-Bb3jzO5nSPbf0XV7tGdn9ZM164J), titled with your name. 

2. In your folder, create a subfolder called `data object`, and into it deposit any python code, photographs or videos of CNC milled parts and soldered LEDs, heightfield images/3D models, datasets, or research documentation. Please do not feel any anxiety if some aspects of your work is incomplete. In fact, feel free to add a file called `to-do.txt` that lists behaviors, functions, and pseudo-code that do not yet work as desired so Zach can help!

3. Into your name folder, please also create a subfolder called `paper`, and drop your short research paper as a PDF, along with any references or code you used to create visualizations.

4. Complete the course evaluation!

Thanks all!
