### Homework for November 5

##### Readings (1 hour)

- Bess Williamson's recent [*Accessible America*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lRB-g2c6-mOYRbo-Usb9As9pjDypJPDH), PDF Pages 145-179.

This chapter narrates the increasing importance of *Universal Design* as a movement in the contemporary design world, and the many antecedents that led up to it. Williamson is trying to link together, with this chapter, the two contrary threads of designing for inclusion and accesibility that we have identified together — and I'm hopeful that some new ideas and compromises might emerge from this short chapter - especially its last few pages.

##### Soldering Practice (2 hours)

- Make some jewelry and fashion to practice soldering! Take some wires and create some bracelets and anklets, necklaces, braided wire art, pins, garment add-ons, anything you like. Bonus points if you solder in some batteries and LEDs (don't forget resistors)! 

- Ensure you have soldered 3 wires onto your LED strip for connecting it to a breadboard.
