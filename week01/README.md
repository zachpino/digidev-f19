### Physical and Digital Develoipment Workshop

Please browse the [course syllabus](PhysDigiDev_F19_v1.pdf), which has more detail.

This recurring course teaches current and emerging electronics and programmatic prototyping tools, so that students are able to fluently develop their design ideas into interactive and responsive outcomes. Physical/Digital Development challenges students to explore how a combined knowledge of design research methods, contemporary technologies, and engineering prototyping tools can contribute to better and more informed designed outcomes. Each semester, the course takes on a specific topic and a new set of technologies, allowing students to retake the course and acquire new skills and exposure to other technological prototyping tools.

Under the theme of data-driven urban transformation, we will be looking at the topic of accessible transit infrastructure, paratransit, autonomous vehicle technologies, and urban-level transit policy. The first several weeks of the course will arm students with Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Python competencies, as well as the technical skills necessary to access and manipulate large datasets. After this tutorial period is finished, students will be able to participate in one of two discrete, but complementary collaborative outcomes.

1. Students in the class may elect to build a data-driven physical model of Chicagoâ€™s transit infrastructure based on public data. This model will be designed to support experimentation around transit policy, and allow users to prototype hypothetical systemic change predicated on existing transit data and patterns. 

2. Students in the class may elect to focus on user-facing transit technologies, and develop autonomous vehicle routing algorithms, sensor- and imaging-driven augmented reality interfaces, and vehicle-level product design interventions.
