### Physical and Digital Development Workshop

Please browse the [course syllabus](PhysDigiDev_F19_v1.pdf), which has more detail.

This recurring course teaches current and emerging electronics and programmatic prototyping tools, so that students are able to fluently develop their design ideas into interactive and responsive outcomes. Physical/Digital Development challenges students to explore how a combined knowledge of design research methods, contemporary technologies, and engineering prototyping tools can contribute to better and more informed designed outcomes. Each semester, the course takes on a specific topic and a new set of technologies, allowing students to retake the course and acquire new skills and exposure to other technological prototyping tools.

Under the theme of data-driven urban transformation, we will be looking at the topic of accessible transit infrastructure, paratransit, autonomous vehicle technologies, and urban-level transit policy. The first several weeks of the course will arm students with Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Python competencies, as well as the technical skills necessary to access and manipulate large datasets. After this tutorial period is finished, students will participate in an experimental, collaborative research project aiming to clarify, visualize, and evaluate design proposals for urban transit. 

Students in the course will construct a data-driven, physical model of Chicago’s transit infrastructure, based on a combination of publicly-available data, research insights, and software-simulated determinations. This model, actuated by LEDs, speakers, screens, projected overlays, and (perhaps) motors, will be designed to enable experimentation in transit policy based on students’ research insights. Users of the model will be able to prototype hypothetical infrastructural changes, municipal policy interventions, and vehicle routing algorithms predicated on existing transit data. The model itself will be built with digital fabrication tools, and students will have light exposure to 3D modeling geographic data with computational milling machines and other digital fabrication tools.
