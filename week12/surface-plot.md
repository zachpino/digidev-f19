We often saw poor performance when creating heightfield surfaces with MatPlotLib's [plot_trisurf method](https://github.com/zachpino/digidev-f19/blob/master/week10/heightfield.md). A slightly different data structure, and a pinch more complicated code, provides for the creation of simpler and more performative geometries.

The major difference between the two is that the `plot_trisurf` method uses an unstructured [delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) and this `plot_surface` method creates a surface composed of [NURBS-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) structured quadrilateral panels. A discussion of the performance implications can be found in this wiki article on [3D mesh composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_mesh#Quadrilateral).

#open an image
img = Image.open("terrain.jpg")

#get rgb pixel data out of image
pixels = list(img.getdata())

#extract native image size

# We need to make sure our height data (measured in brightness from 0 to 255) matches our locational data (measured in pixels in the dimensions of the heightfield image).
# So, in order to bring the dimensions into alignment, we need to relate both latitude and elevation to *actual meters* through a scaling factor. 
# Note that longitude is not considered. There will be slight deformation on longitude as a result â€” worsening closer to the poles.
# It is impossible to flatten the earth without deformation, so though we could take other complex trigonometric steps that are location-dependent to minimize this deformation, it is in most cases a futile battle.
